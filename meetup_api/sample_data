Are you a young adult looking to make new friends and gain new experiences? Then this is the group for you. With over 15 superstar organizers, there are always exciting events on the horizon that should be able to satisfy a wide range of interests.</p>\n<p>But what about our group name? The first thing that comes to many people\'s minds when they see "Extremely Shy- Looking for Friends" is: Do I have to be extremely shy to join this group? And the answer is most definitely no. People of all levels of introversion and extroversion are welcome to join our group. In fact, if you were to randomly stumble upon our group during one of our events, you would be very unlikely to tell us apart from any of the other number of social meetup group in Vancouver. Many of our members are not shy, and many more have largely overcome their shyness since joining our group. This is a major reason why we\'re slowly transitioning to the name "ESV".</p>\n<p>That being said, as somebody who used to be very shy, I know what it\'s like. I know how hard it can be to take that first step in trying to exit your comfort zone. And so one of the purposes of this group, is to make that first step as easy for you as possible. But if you are still too shy to come out to an event, then send us an email by clicking <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Extremely-Shy-Looking-for-friends/suggestion/">here</a> and we will do everything possible to make coming out to that first event as easy as possible.</p>\n<p> <br> Check out this promo video to get a feel for what our group is all about:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a class="embedded" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzBIvG2FQo0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzBIvG2FQo0</a></p>\n<p>Another great thing about this group, and a large reason for our success, is that we like to encourage all of our members to get involved in planning and helping to host events. Anybody who has attended at least one event is welcome to post a meetup of their own.
