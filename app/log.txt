9    <p>TechVancouver Meetup is the best way to expand your knowledge and network of the Vancouver technology community. Each monthly TechVancouver Meetup is designed for Vancouver technologists to learn something new and meet someone new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll learn something new from one of our 5x5s, or four presentations of five minutes each. Each presentation is made by a Vancouver technology company big or small, and they use their time to share a lesson learned, a counter-intuitive finding, or demo a new technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll meet someone new over some food and drinks provided before each 5x5. Every TechVan also includes a Community Mic session, where anyone in attendance has a chance to address the entire event to promote themselves, their product, their event, or whatever they want!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested in presenting, sponsoring or volunteering? Contact us through Meetup or email Alex at alex@techvancouver.org.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TechVancouver Meetup is presented by TechVancouver.org, an organization supporting the growth and development of the Vancouver tech community.</p>

9    <p>We invite startup leaders and experts to share their startup story and subject expertise relevant to startups and businesses. We bring value by asking them the hard questions everyone want to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been to many meetups and are tired of hearing people share generic surface level stuff what can be found on blogs and we want the meat and bread wisdom from founders. We focus on sharing stories and practical startup growth tactics that can help you go from 0 to 45K on Instagram in a few months, how to build a powerhouse team, how to get traction or approach reporters and writers, how to start a startup as a non technical and many more.</p>
<p>Vancouver is a growing entrepreneurial hub with many established and prominent upcoming startups. There are startup grants, good support, available capital and quality talents helping many startups scale big. There is no better time to start a startup than today here in Vancouver.</p>

<p><b>Involve</b>- Go far and deep with our community. Connect with startup folks at our networking events, meet a co-founder and get started in a startup. </p>

9    <p><b>As far as we know, this is the only regular, weekly meetup in Vancouver where developers, architects and product owners can get together and gain hands-on experience in Domain Driven Design, building event sourced microservices and applying other modern software delivery techniques. (Any others? Please drop us a line – we’d love to hear from you!)</b></p>
<p>We event-storm problems, try out designs and implement, learning from each other. We tend to be strongly focused on business value and business objectives. As far as technology is concerned, we are language-agnostic and have so far played with C#, Go and JavaScript. Attendees are usually a mixed bunch, from absolute beginners to folks who have built software for a quarter century or more, with new people and regulars dropping by all the time.</p>
<p>Based on experiences from two previous “projects” we did (a hotel management system and an e-commerce platform), we are changing the format of the meetup so we have more time to experiment with a particular problem domain: Meetups will be series of three, designing and partially implementing a system over three weeks.</p>
<p><b>To explore from scratch: Join us for a three week series. </b></p>
<p><b>Only interested in specific topics? Drop by anytime.</b></p>

9    <p><b>Calling all Women who are Dynamic!</b>&nbsp;Dynamic Women™ in Action was created by Diane Rolston, a Certified Life and Leadership Coach, International Speaker and Author, to connect women who are creating an impact in their lives, businesses and communities (or those who wish they could do it more!)</p>
<p>Dynamic Women™ in Action events&nbsp;are unique&nbsp;because you get Coaching in Action© from a Certified Professional Coach&nbsp;who leads you through engaging activities to get clearer about what makes you great, things that can help you succeed and the obstacles holding you back. &nbsp;We attract women who are&nbsp;authentic, supportive and believe in personal and&nbsp;professional&nbsp;development. <br></p>
<p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/5/9/600_444475129.jpeg"></p>
<p><b>We believe in building strong relationships</b> that support business and personal growth.&nbsp;Through our events and community, DWA™ provides a great space for women to come and be DYNAMIC, feel connected and get coaching that is a catalyst for change in their lives and businesses</p>
<p><span><b>You should join if any of these are true about you:</b></span> <br></p>
<ul> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you are dynamic (or really hope you could be soon)</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you want to make REAL relationships with other women</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you're sick of having people sell to you in the first 30 seconds of meeting them</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you don't schedule time for yourself (yes that's a bad habit)</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you need to chat with other people who GET what it's like to be a business professional, mompreneur, entrepreneur or small business owner</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you like knowing more about what makes you and others tick</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you need some inspiration, tools, tips, support, motivation</p> 
 <p>•&nbsp;you're a little curious about what this could do for you, your business and/or your life</p> 
</ul>
<p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/7/4/4/600_444475108.jpeg"></p>
<p><span><b>Women in our community say that after our events they have the following benefits:</b></span> <br></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Have&nbsp;new motivation&nbsp;so you can have <b>GREATER EASE AND ENERGY</b> in your business.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Get&nbsp;great ideas, which will <b>INSPIRE BREAKTHROUGHS</b> and take you and your&nbsp;business to the next level.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Share with others&nbsp;who are on their own business journey, so you know others “get it” and you’ll BE INSPIRED by their stories and ideas.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Through the Coaching in Action© and discussions you’ll&nbsp;discover tangible tools, a solution or even an “AHA” to put into action.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Experience GENUINE CONNECTIONS rather than superficial conversations so you can be yourself and “ditch your pitch”.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Create&nbsp;strong relationships&nbsp;with other like-minded women who are more open to getting to know YOU and when we like and trust each other A LOT OF BUSINESS happens naturally!</p>
<p>Come as you are...and join us at our next event!</p>

We do sometimes put an extra two to five dollar meetup event fee onto random event, this is only to pay for the meetup group fees that Meetup.com charges for te group. All other events are at the/your cost of the event.</span></p>

<p>What makes one newcomer’s integration more successful than another? Shifting one’s cultural identity with new roles, values and beliefs in the new society is a start. Also, engaging with people outside of your own ethnic group work helps that adjustment.</p>
<p> <br></p>
<p>3 Stages to resettlement <br> There are three stages to a newcomer’s adaptation in a new country: friends, employment and transportation. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><strong>Employment</strong></p>
<p>It is challenging to find work, especially when you are new to Canada. Learn what to expect, where to find information about jobs in BC, and who to talk to if you want help. We work with different career college who provide training and job placement program. Please send an email with your resume to <a href="mailto:365referral@gmail.com">365referral@gmail.com</a> if you need help looking for a job in vancouver. We may not find the dream job for you, but at least get you a decent&nbsp;job to pay your bills. We will have meetup based on job fair and career opportunities. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>
<p>To get around easily in today's big cities, especially in their sparsely populated suburbs, access to a private motor vehicle is not only very convenient but sometimes absolutely essential. Parents with young children know this only too well, since they often have to commute to work and back, drive the children to the daycare centre or evening activities, go to an appointment, shop for dinner and do other things besides – all in the same day. </p>
<p> <br></p>
<p> We helps newcomers get car loans regardless of previous credit history. Our Goal is to ensure that you are able to obtain the vehicle you need, regardless of your credit score. Please give me a call, if you need assistance to get your first car in Canada. My cell number is 778-855-6681. </p>
